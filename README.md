Uno is a simple level editor meant for games where a level fist the whole screen.

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ 

Still heavily in development, there is no documentation available yet, this is open
for the sake of having its dependencies available to other projects. If you still inclined
on using it anyway, a MacOS app can be download from the releases section here in the repository
and you can check the example for how to use it.
